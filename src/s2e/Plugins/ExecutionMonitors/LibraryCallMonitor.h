///
/// \brief Monitors external library function calls.
///
/// This plugin can be used to determine what external library calls a particular module makes at run time (including
/// both libraries and process main binaries). The modules to monitor are those defined in the
/// \code ProcessExecutionDetector plugin's config.
///
/// The plugin works as follows:
///   \li All indirect calls are monitored. Library calls are always made indirectly (via either the PLT in ELF
///       binaries or the IAT in PE binaries)
///   \li When an indirect call is made, we look up the module that contains the call target address
///   \li Once we find that module, we can search its export table to find an entry that matches the call target
///       address. If a match is found, report it
///
/// Note that this approach does not use the callee module's import table. This means that library calls that are not
/// listed in the import table are still monitored. This is beneficial for malware analysis, where the import table
/// is often destroyed and library calls are made "indirectly" (e.g. via \code LoadLibrary and \code GetProcAddress).
///
/// <h2>Configuration Options</h2>
///
///   \li \code monitorAllModules: enable if you want to track library calls from \a all modules used by the module
///       specified in the \code ProcessExecutionDetector plugin config.
///   \li \code monitorIndirectJumps: enable if you want to track library calls that are made via jumps, not just via
///       calls. For example, malware might do this as an obfuscation technique.
